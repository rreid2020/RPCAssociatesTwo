## Important: Dynamic Content

### Article Pages (Individual Articles)
**Note:** Individual article pages are dynamic and should be automatically discovered via:
1. The sitemap.xml (already submitted)
2. Internal links from the articles listing page
3. Category pages

You can submit individual article URLs manually if you have specific high-value articles, but the sitemap should handle most of them automatically.

### Sitemap (Already Submitted)
- https://rpcassociates.co/sitemap.xml ✅ (Already submitted)

## Recommended Submission Order

1. **First:** Submit the sitemap.xml (if not already done)
   - Go to Google Search Console → Sitemaps → Submit: `https://rpcassociates.co/sitemap.xml`

2. **Second:** Use "URL Inspection" tool to submit these high-priority pages:
   - Homepage
   - All 6 service pages
   - Tax calculator page
   - Book consultation page

3. **Third:** Submit remaining static pages (Resources, Articles, Privacy, Terms)

4. **Fourth:** Monitor and submit individual article pages as they are published (or let the sitemap handle them)

## How to Submit URLs

### Method 1: URL Inspection Tool (Recommended for Priority Pages)
1. Go to Google Search Console
2. Click "URL Inspection" in the left menu
3. Enter each URL
4. Click "Request Indexing" button

### Method 2: Sitemap Submission (Best for All Pages)
1. Go to Google Search Console
2. Click "Sitemaps" in the left menu
3. Enter: `https://rpcassociates.co/sitemap.xml`
4. Click "Submit"

The sitemap will automatically include:
- All static pages
- All service pages
- All published articles
- Article category pages

## Notes

- **Client Portal** (`/client-portal`) is a "Coming Soon" page - you may want to exclude this from indexing or submit it later
- Article pages are dynamically generated from Sanity CMS and will be included in your sitemap automatically
- Google will crawl and index pages from your sitemap over time, so you don't need to manually submit every single URL
- Focus on submitting the high-priority pages (homepage, services, key resources) first
